## Task(s) Where AI Was Used

### Task 1: [Describe the task]
**Example:** "Statsmodels formula syntax for OLS regression"

**Prompt:**
```
[Exact prompt text you provided to the AI]
```

**AI Output:**
```
[What the AI suggested or generated]
```

**Verification & Modifications (Disclose • Verify • Critique):**
- **Verify:** [How you checked the output — e.g., "Ran the code on sample data and confirmed it produced a regression table"]
- **Critique:** [What was wrong, incomplete, or needed refinement — e.g., "AI used the wrong variable name; I corrected it to match the dataset (div12m_me, prime_rate, ffo_at_reit)"]
- **Modify:** [What you changed in your final work — e.g., "Changed variable to `div12m_me` and added comments explaining the formula"]

---

### Task 2: [Describe the task]
**Example:** "Interpretation of regression coefficients"

**Prompt:**
```
[Exact prompt text]
```

**AI Output:**
```
[What the AI suggested]
```

**Verification & Modifications:**
- **Verify:** [How you checked the interpretation — e.g., "Cross-referenced with lecture notes and textbook"]
- **Critique:** [What was wrong — e.g., "AI said 'beta measures sensitivity' but didn't clarify units or economic meaning"]
- **Modify:** [What you changed — e.g., "Rewrote interpretation to include economic context and proper units"]

---

### Task 3: [Describe the task]
**Example:** "Creating a scatter plot with matplotlib (ret vs. div12m_me)"

**Prompt:**
```
[Exact prompt text]
```

**AI Output:**
```
[What the AI suggested]
```

**Verification & Modifications:**
- **Verify:** [How you checked — e.g., "Generated the plot and confirmed it matched the assignment requirements"]
- **Critique:** [What needed improvement — e.g., "AI didn't add axis labels or title"]
- **Modify:** [What you changed — e.g., "Added title, axis labels, and legend as required"]
